# Procedure:
1.	Begin by filling the source reservoir with water. Water will fill the reservoir until it reaches the level of the marked table surface.
2.	As a result of the incline of the apparatus, the water should flow down in a thin sheet along the table surface.
3.	If the glass cover is in place, then the water should be flowing between the table surface and the glass cover.
4.	Any air pockets should be evacuated before injecting the dye.
5.	Place the desired body on the table surface and begin injecting the dye. 
6.	Data collection, in the form of digital photos, can begin once the flow has reached steady-state.
